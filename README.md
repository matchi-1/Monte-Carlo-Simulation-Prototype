# Monte Carlo Algorithm

The Monte Carlo algorithm is a probabilistic model that uses random sampling to approximate solutions for complex mathematical and real-world problems. Instead of solving equations directly, it generates many random inputs, observes the results, and derives an estimate based on statistical properties. It is commonly used for probability estimation, optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty.
